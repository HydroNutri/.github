# Hydro Nutri

## 📌 Introduction
This project integrates **artificial intelligence** and **hardware** to develop a smart home-based **aquaponics system**. By leveraging AI-driven automation, we aim to optimize the growth of **both fish and plants** in a self-sustaining environment. This system utilizes **fish waste as organic fertilizer**, creating a natural ecosystem that enhances efficiency and sustainability.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **AI-Driven Monitoring & Control**  
  AI optimizes water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions in real time.
- **Closed-Loop Ecosystem**  
  Fish feces are processed into **natural fertilizer**, providing essential nutrients to plants.
- **Smart Sensor Integration**  
  Sensors measure pH, ammonia, nitrate levels, and temperature, ensuring ideal conditions.
- **Automated Water Filtration**  
  A filtering mechanism cleans water and cycles it back into the fish tank, promoting sustainability.
- **Machine Learning for Yield Optimization**  
  AI models analyze data to **enhance fish growth** and **improve crop production**.

## 🏗 System Architecture

- **AI Module**: Uses machine learning models to analyze environmental data and optimize system parameters.  
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Collects real-time data on water quality, temperature, and nutrient levels.  
- **Automated Control System**: Adjusts feeding, water flow, and other parameters based on AI predictions.  
- **Aquaponics System**: Houses fish and plants in a closed-loop setup that recycles nutrients efficiently.  

## 🔧 Hardware Components
- **Microcontrollers & Sensors**: Raspberry Pi / Arduino, pH sensors, ammonia detectors, temperature sensors.
- **AI Processing Unit**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano or similar AI-capable hardware.
- **Water Pump & Filtration System**: Maintains clean water and efficient nutrient cycling.
- **LED Grow Lights**: Provides optimal lighting for plant growth.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Fish are fed** and produce waste.  
2. **Waste is broken down** by beneficial bacteria into nutrients.  
3. **Plants absorb the nutrients**, purifying the water.  
4. **Clean water is cycled back** to the fish tank.  
5. **AI continuously optimizes** the process based on sensor data.

## 📈 AI & Machine Learning
- **Water Quality Prediction**: Detects potential issues before they affect fish or plants.
- **Growth Rate Optimization**: Uses past data to improve fish and crop yield.
- **Energy Efficiency Management**: Optimizes pump cycles and lighting schedules.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **IoT Dashboard** for remote monitoring and control.
- **Integration with renewable energy sources** (e.g., solar power).
- **Enhanced AI models** for better decision-making.
